# myHomeLibrary

MyHomeLibrary is an individual library for your home as an iPhone application.
Do you have many books (maybe in different rooms) and you want to read that book twice or more often, but you can't find it?

This app helps you to find it. First you have to scan your books with an integrated barcode scanner and tell it where is it.
